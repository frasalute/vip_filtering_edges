# vip_filtering_edges

This code is for the assignment 2 in the Vision and Image Processing
All of the assignment questions are answered within. The code is meant to run in one go. 

We used the provided image 'Mandrill' which is the one you will see throughout the different plots with different processing techniques applied to it.

Required libraries are as follows:
1. OpenCV
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Scipy

Important to note when running the code:
1. You only have to press run and it will go through all the code.
2. The first image is the original mandrill image.
3. Each plot that comes up is tied to the individual assignment.
4. For the original image and the grayscale press whatever key and they will close down.
5. For all other images and plots, when you close a plot a new one will come up.
6. You have an indefinite amount to look at each plot
